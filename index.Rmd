Hello, visitors! 
This website is for my class ANLY503 - Data Visualization. The site has two sections. One that focuses on the homework done throughout the course and another that contains the final project. 

I have omitted Homework 6 due to not submitting it. Homeworks 1-3 were hand drawing assignments which are omitted. Homework 4 was a data wrangling assignment which only outputted csv's, so that is also omitted. Homework 5 and 7 are both visualizations.
